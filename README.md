# What is this mod?
ScoreboardTweaks is a simple (maybe) mod that changes your Scoreboard to be more comfortable and more understandable (MAYBE???)

## Manual Installation
Be sure that you are already installed BepInEx (using MonkeModManager for example). You need x64 version. [Take it there.](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

Unpack downloaded ZIP Archive to your GorillaTag game folder and you're ready to play!

If you're scared then copy DLL and PNG files to your Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/plugins folder somewhere (Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/ScoreboardTweaks/ for example).

## How that looks?
